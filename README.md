Interacting with the insect collections of the Museum of Natural History in Berlin

With Daniel Weiss I did a mapping of the taxonomic sequences in the https://www.zoosphere.net/ dataset of the Museum für Naturkunde (Museum of Natural History) in Berlin (CSV is the tidied data of full sequences of order-genus-species pulled from the API). We then developed an interface for browsing the taxonomy in a fluid visual way.
